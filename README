Rails Stripe Membership Saas
========================

You can use this project as a starting point for a Rails web application. On 20150418, it is running on Ruby 2.2.2 and Rails 4.2.1 and uses Devise for user management and authentication, enum for roles authorization, Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styling, and Payola and Stripe.com for processings of products purchased and recurring billing for subscriptions and donations. You create the plans on Stripe and describe them as you wish in your app.
