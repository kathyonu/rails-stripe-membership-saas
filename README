Rails Stripe Membership Saas
========================

We recommend you follow/fork the RailsApps master at :

https://github.com/railsapps/rails-stripe-membership-saas

You can use this project as a starting point for a Rails web application. 

On 20150419, our fork is running on Ruby 2.2.2, on Rails 4.2.1, uses 
Devise for user management and authentication, enum for roles authorization, 
Twitter Bootstrap for CSS styling, and Payola and Stripe.com for processing 
of products purchased and recurring billing for subscriptions and donations. 
You create the plans on Stripe and describe them as you wish in your app.
